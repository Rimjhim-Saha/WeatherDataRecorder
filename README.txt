   - Average Temperature
   - Weather Condition Counts
✔ Export data to a file named 'weather_data.csv'
✔ Interactive menu-driven interface

How to Run:
------------
1. Open the folder in VS Code or any code editor.
2. Open terminal and run:
   python weather_recorder.py
3. Use the menu options to add/view/export data.

Requirements:
